"March 22, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Rick Layton,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I made a mistake. The original Earpods that came with my Apple iPhone 6 Plus started cutting out. I decided for the cheaper option of the Amazon headphones rather than a slightly more expensive Earpod replacement.  I now regret that decision.The Amazon headphones are not even CLOSE to the same comfort, fit, quality as the Apple Earpods.  No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fit the Amazon headphones in my ear. I tried the different sizes and twisted. They would stay in a few minutes and then pop out.  It was a disaster for exercising.I found the Amazon headphones very uncomfortable. They didn't just sit in the ears like the Apple Earpods.  They had to be squeezed inside the ear canal. Obviously Apple (and all manufactures) have patents on their designs that Amazon cannot copy.  So, Amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design.  It's just NOT good.  And it plugged the ears so much that I heard my breathing and heartbeat.  Once I put them in, I couldn't wait to get them back out.The sound quality is garbage. It's not even CLOSE to the quality of the Apple Earpods.  The sound is loud, but very harsh and tinny. I guess if I never had any headphones before and used the Amazon headphones, I would probably just accept it because I had nothing to compare it to.  However, I had the Apple Earpods, so I could make a direct comparison.  It's not even close. So, I went ahead and ordered another Apple Earpods - which is only about $5 more.  I should have done that initially.  I cannot recommend the Amazon headphones.",87 people found this helpful
"April 3, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very inexpensive headphones but they exceeded my expectations. The silicone pieces (there are 3 sets in order to fit your ears) are effective at cancelling out noise at a general office/home level. These also stay put well so long as you choose the right size of silicone cover.,63 people found this helpful

"July 21, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Bob K,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually buy Skullcandy Ink'd, but bought these to save a couple of bucks.  The buds fit more comfortably than the Ink'd, but it went downhill from there.  The wires feel stiffer and smaller gauge, which suggests they will break sooner.  When I began listening, it was quickly apparent I had wasted my money, as the sound quality was bad -- the sound is somewhat muddled, and they sound tinny with a very poor base response.  These will go into my ""shoulda know better"" drawer.On the bright side, I went back to Amazon and just scored two sets of Ink'd for the same price I paid for the bad set.Such is Life",7 people found this helpful
"April 12, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Robert Beauregard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Who'd have thunk it? Noise-canceling earbuds for less than $9?I needed wired earbuds to use on my laptop now that this COVID-19 pandemic has 97% of people staying at home. I'm lucky enough to have a job I can do remotely and my company has been using Zoom video conferencing. My wireless Bluetooth headphones didn't present a professional appearance, not to mention my phone kept fighting my laptop for the BT connection.These cheap earbuds sound great and the built-in speaker on the left earbud wire makes my voice very clear.

Seriously 100 times worse than $2 pair I bought at Bartel drugs. I am an audiophile and have headphones of all varieties, I wanted something I could toss in my work bag for conference calls, its sad Amazon has stooped to relabeling the cheapest Chinese crap they can get their hands on, I expected a lot more from Amazon, especially for the higher price.",9 people found this helpful
"March 12, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Annie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After 2.5 years with my trusty earbuds that came with my iPhone died after a tug-o-war with my dog, it came time for me to go on the hunt for a new pair of earbuds.  My budget was a laughable $10, just because I only use these when I'm out jogging with my dog.  After a few misses, I settled on these AmazonBasics earbuds.  I was wary because of the lack of reviews on this product, but given how everything I've bought from AmazonBasics has been of decent quality, I figured ""why not?"".  I've had these guys for a little over a month and I'm so pleasantly surprised by the quality.  I'm usually not a fan of the earbuds with the fitted earbuds, as they have always come off as uncomfortable for me.  These were surprisingly comfortable.  I think it's because the shape of the contour is more oval than circular, so it fits better with the ear hole.  The tangle-free cord is amazing, and it's at a good length where it's not too long nor too short.  The speaker and mic are decent, I haven't experienced any static nor has the people I've talked to on the phone heard rustling sounds from the mic brushing against my clothes.  Overall, I'm pretty sure this is one of the best deals you can get at this price point.",3 people found this helpful
"September 2, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,kevinf,4.0 out of 5 stars,I purchased the a white pair of AmazonBasics In-Ear wired Headphone Earbuds with a microphone. These work great and I haven't had any issues. They sound great with the exception of me wanting more bass. However; I buy a good pair of ear buds separately that are to certain specifications to include heavy Bass and I purchased these AmazonBasics as a back up pair.These sound great and are equivalent to headphone earbuds double the cost. I usually allow myself 20$ for back up earbuds and figured I'd save some cash by buying these and gave them a shot. They work just as well as more expensive pairs and fit better then most. Definitely recommend as a decent pair and already bought myself a lime green pair instead of the white for another back up. If you're looking for a pair with good stereo bass then you may be satisfied because it's there... but I wasn't because I like more of a range than these buds deliver. The other sound ranges are there and sound better than many ear buds I've tried and are well worth the price. Functionality is there with the button working for answering the phone and pausing of media.,2 people found this helpful
"October 6, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Greenbeans,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They sound great, noise cancel unless kids are screaming at each other and are somewhat comfortable.  I do not like the ""ergonomic"" earbud where you have to put it in the correct ear.  If it's not in exactly correct it feels like the hard plastic ear buds.  I haven't tried the microphone so I can't review that. Over all it's a pretty good earbud for the price.  I would recommend it to someone who doesn't mind the r/l earbud setup.",4 people found this helpful
"May 27, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,CobaltLTH,5.0 out of 5 stars,So I typically purchase the Panasonic wired earbuds because they fit my ears the best and the sound is decent.  However I have noticed lately the price has been climbing and I decided to look for an more cost effective alternative.  These fit the bill.  Their sound quality and shape are comparable to the ones I usually buy and they were cheaper.  The only thing that was really different was that the mic was on the left wire when typically it's in the right in past wired earbuds I've purchased. Not at all and issue for me and maybe a great option for left handed individuals!,0 people found this helpful
"May 27, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Sean B,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The product came wrapped in bubble wrap and tape, no real packaging.  The sound quality would be great but their is a lot of static.  The tips are pretty comfortable and it stayed in my ear on treadmill. I got the red and the color is very muted, almost pastel like, I was hoping the color was more bold or bright. At least they were cheap, might not return and just keep for backup.",4 people found this helpful
"February 14, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Char,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These seem comparable to the Apple wired earbuds that come w iPhone but WAY more comfortable and lightweight. So much so i prefer them over any ear plugs I always use at night. Thats because they fit better and cancel noise better.  Been knowing I shldnt wait for them to get damaged, need to order couple extra sets of these for their nice $8sumthing price.  However, these dont have as much bass as my “Tidybuds” wireless Bluetooth ear buds from Groupon.

"March 31, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,A Reader NYC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I bought these in white for $7.87 and also a pair of Sephia SO3060 wired earbuds for $12.95.  I liked these much better for listening to audiobooks and courses - the sound quality was clearer.  The comfort was about the same for each set-not bad - I just used the ear tips that were on them when they came.  The packaging of the Sephia earbuds was a fancy 3 layer arrangement that was impossible to get open without tearing the box so I guess I can't return them.  The Amazon wired earbuds are much more tangle free than my previous pair, and they came simply packed in a small plastic bag that was very easy to open.",0 people found this helpful

"March 14, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Jon Janaka,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is my second pair of Amazon Basics ear buds. Last pair made it almost 2 years of daily use, ordered these as a replacement.Mechanical isolation is outstanding just putting these in drops the noise level considerably. 3 sizes of tips included. No line noise from taps. Cable could be longer. Very comfortable snug fit in ear.Clean bass, good response throughout the spectrum. Mostly use for vdo chat, but testing with some Amazon Prime video gives immersive sound. This is not audiophile gear but certainly gets the job done. Very impressed with the improvement on the last Amazon Basics ear buds I purchased - well worth being double the price.",One person found this helpful
"August 26, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Giselle Garcia,1.0 out of 5 stars,"I’m a teacher and bought this product since we start virtual teaching and needed headphones with a mic so my students could hear me clearly.

Since these were basically supposed to be just for one day, I didn't want to spend much, and I didn't have high expectations.  What a nice surprise I got with these.  For under $10, they're comfortable, and work really well.  The don't block out noise completely, like my fancy pair, but they provide decent sound and don't hurt my ears.  They were supposed to be a one day patch, but I like them so well that I keep them in my bag all the time.

"October 20, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Julia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I mean, they're not Bose or Beats or anything like that, BUT they are surprisingly good. The bass is good, and they can be VERY loud, or pretty quiet, so the volume control is good. They come with more ear cushions if your ears are smaller or bigger than the default ones, so they fit very nice. Truthfully, I think the sound quality with these is just as good as my AirPods, and they fit better. The only thing I like better about the AirPods is that they're Bluetooth and these are obviously not. You should totally buy these!",0 people found this helpful
