"March 22, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Rick Layton,2.0,"I made a mistake. The original Earpods that came with my Apple iPhone 6 Plus started cutting out. I decided for the cheaper option of the Amazon headphones rather than a slightly more expensive Earpod replacement. I now regret that decision.

The Amazon headphones are not even CLOSE to the same comfort, fit, quality as the Apple Earpods. No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fit the Amazon headphones in my ear. I tried the different sizes and twisted. They would stay in a few minutes and then pop out. It was a disaster for exercising.

I found the Amazon headphones very uncomfortable. They didn't just sit in the ears like the Apple Earpods. They had to be squeezed inside the ear canal. Obviously Apple (and all manufactures) have patents on their designs that Amazon cannot copy. So, Amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design. It's just NOT good. And it plugged the ears so much that I heard my breathing and heartbeat. Once I put them in, I couldn't wait to get them back out.

The sound quality is garbage. It's not even CLOSE to the quality of the Apple Earpods. The sound is loud, but very harsh and tinny. I guess if I never had any headphones before and used the Amazon headphones, I would probably just accept it because I had nothing to compare it to. However, I had the Apple Earpods, so I could make a direct comparison. It's not even close. So, I went ahead and ordered another Apple Earpods - which is only about $5 more. I should have done that initially. I cannot recommend the Amazon headphones.

"April 3, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Emily,5.0,"These are very inexpensive headphones but they exceeded my expectations. The silicone pieces (there are 3 sets in order to fit your ears) are effective at cancelling out noise at a general office/home level. These also stay put well so long as you choose the right size of silicone cover.

"February 11, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Ed W.,5.0,"The Amazon basic ear headphones works in the iPhones with clear and loud audio on the ear pieces as well as speaking into the mic. Although its fidelity on both is not as good as the APPLE branded version, it is still very useable. Will buy again and recommend this as a low cost item.

"July 21, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Bob K,2.0,"I usually buy Skullcandy Ink'd, but bought these to save a couple of bucks. The buds fit more comfortably than the Ink'd, but it went downhill from there. The wires feel stiffer and smaller gauge, which suggests they will break sooner. When I began listening, it was quickly apparent I had wasted my money, as the sound quality was bad -- the sound is somewhat muddled, and they sound tinny with a very poor base response. These will go into my ""shoulda know better"" drawer.
On the bright side, I went back to Amazon and just scored two sets of Ink'd for the same price I paid for the bad set.

"April 12, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Robert Beauregard,5.0,"Who'd have thunk it? Noise-canceling earbuds for less than $9?

I needed wired earbuds to use on my laptop now that this COVID-19 pandemic has 97% of people staying at home. I'm lucky enough to have a job I can do remotely and my company has been using Zoom video conferencing. My wireless Bluetooth headphones didn't present a professional appearance, not to mention my phone kept fighting my laptop for the BT connection.

These cheap earbuds sound great and the built-in speaker on the left earbud wire makes my voice very clear. It has made my stay-at-home time a little more bearable.",4 people found this helpful

"March 12, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Annie,5.0,"After 2.5 years with my trusty earbuds that came with my iPhone died after a tug-o-war with my dog, it came time for me to go on the hunt for a new pair of earbuds. My budget was a laughable $10, just because I only use these when I'm out jogging with my dog. After a few misses, I settled on these AmazonBasics earbuds. I was wary because of the lack of reviews on this product, but given how everything I've bought from AmazonBasics has been of decent quality, I figured ""why not?"". I've had these guys for a little over a month and I'm so pleasantly surprised by the quality. I'm usually not a fan of the earbuds with the fitted earbuds, as they have always come off as uncomfortable for me. These were surprisingly comfortable. I think it's because the shape of the contour is more oval than circular, so it fits better with the ear hole. The tangle-free cord is amazing, and it's at a good length where it's not too long nor too short. The speaker and mic are decent, I haven't experienced any static nor has the people I've talked to on the phone heard rustling sounds from the mic brushing against my clothes. Overall, I'm pretty sure this is one of the best deals you can get at this price point.",3 people found this helpful
"September 2, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,kevinfTop Contributor: Pets,4.0,"I purchased the a white pair of AmazonBasics In-Ear wired Headphone Earbuds with a microphone. These work great and I haven't had any issues. They sound great with the exception of me wanting more bass. However; I buy a good pair of ear buds separately that are to certain specifications to include heavy Bass and I purchased these AmazonBasics as a back up pair.

These sound great and are equivalent to headphone earbuds double the cost. I usually allow myself 20$ for back up earbuds and figured I'd save some cash by buying these and gave them a shot. They work just as well as more expensive pairs and fit better then most. Definitely recommend as a decent pair and already bought myself a lime green pair instead of the white for another back up. If you're looking for a pair with good stereo bass then you may be satisfied because it's there... but I wasn't because I like more of a range than these buds deliver. The other sound ranges are there and sound better than many ear buds I've tried and are well worth the price. Functionality is there with the button working for answering the phone and pausing of media.",2 people found this helpful
"October 6, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Greenbeans,4.0,"They sound great, noise cancel unless kids are screaming at each other and are somewhat comfortable. I do not like the ""ergonomic"" earbud where you have to put it in the correct ear. If it's not in exactly correct it feels like the hard plastic ear buds. I haven't tried the microphone so I can't review that. Over all it's a pretty good earbud for the price. I would recommend it to someone who doesn't mind the r/l earbud setup.",4 people found this helpful
"May 27, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,CobaltLTH,5.0,So I typically purchase the Panasonic wired earbuds because they fit my ears the best and the sound is decent. However I have noticed lately the price has been climbing and I decided to look for an more cost effective alternative. These fit the bill. Their sound quality and shape are comparable to the ones I usually buy and they were cheaper. The only thing that was really different was that the mic was on the left wire when typically it's in the right in past wired earbuds I've purchased. Not at all and issue for me and maybe a great option for left handed individuals!,No people found this helpful
"May 27, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Sean B,2.0,"The product came wrapped in bubble wrap and tape, no real packaging. The sound quality would be great but their is a lot of static. The tips are pretty comfortable and it stayed in my ear on treadmill. I got the red and the color is very muted, almost pastel like, I was hoping the color was more bold or bright. At least they were cheap, might not return and just keep for backup.

So much so i prefer them over any ear plugs I always use at night. Thats because they fit better and cancel noise better. Been knowing I shldnt wait for them to get damaged, need to order couple extra sets of these for their nice $8sumthing price.

"March 31, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,A Reader NYC,5.0,"I bought these in white for $7.87 and also a pair of Sephia SO3060 wired earbuds for $12.95. I liked these much better for listening to audiobooks and courses - the sound quality was clearer. The comfort was about the same for each set-not bad - I just used the ear tips that were on them when they came. The packaging of the Sephia earbuds was a fancy 3 layer arrangement that was impossible to get open without tearing the box so I guess I can't return them. The Amazon wired earbuds are much more tangle free than my previous pair, and they came simply packed in a small plastic bag that was very easy to open.",No people found this helpful

"March 6, 2021",Reviewed in the United States,Kindle Customer,1.0,"It's been a real long time since I've bought headphones at any price-point that sound awful at any volume.

Pros:
- it works?
- the bass is surprisingly decent?

Cons:
- distortion at ANY volume
- feels cheaper than competitors at this price point

Notes: they have attempted to create a much wider soundstage than these headphones are capable of delivering, as a result the instant a song gets even slightly intense it will distort across the entire soundstage, obviously this is unacceptable. I've had much better experiences with headphones in this same price-point, your better off trying literally any other cheap headphones on amazon, please do not buy these.",2 people found this helpful

Mechanical isolation is outstanding just putting these in drops the noise level considerably. 3 sizes of tips included. No line noise from taps. Cable could be longer. Very comfortable snug fit in ear.

Clean bass, good response throughout the spectrum. Mostly use for vdo chat, but testing with some Amazon Prime video gives immersive sound. This is not audiophile gear but certainly gets the job done. Very impressed with the improvement on the last Amazon Basics ear buds I purchased - well worth being double the price.",One person found this helpful
"August 26, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Giselle Garcia,1.0,"I’m a teacher and bought this product since we start virtual teaching and needed headphones with a mic so my students could hear me clearly. The headphones maybe sounded well for 5 seconds, 6 seconds tops, then it made my students sound like robots who are powered by dollar store batteries. I’m in quarantine so I can’t return them at the moment, and I have to order a different set 🙄
Y’all know how much teachers make??? I don’t have the time or money to be buy headphones just for them to not work. I miss hearing my students complain about math and now I won’t be able to hear the sighs when they realize they still have 79 minutes of class left.

In all seriousness, save your money and don’t buy these ear bud head phones.

Since these were basically supposed to be just for one day, I didn't want to spend much, and I didn't have high expectations. What a nice surprise I got with these. For under $10, they're comfortable, and work really well. The don't block out noise completely, like my fancy pair, but they provide decent sound and don't hurt my ears.

There are a couple of features that I wasn’t aware of:
1) You will need a converter to use with your iPhone X
2) the control button is NOT for volume. You will only be able to start and stop music or use the microphone.

Nevertheless, it’s definitely a keeper since I have an earphone converter and it’s the perfect shade of pink💕

"February 8, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Ohstacy,4.0,"There are so many different styles and models of earphones to choose from, finding a perfect set of earphones isn’t an easy task. Rest assured, however, the AmazonBasics in-Ear Headphones are a good, basic set. They pair effortlessly to my iPhone and keep a solid Bluetooth connection when I’m receiving calls as well as listening to music.

Speaking of music, I don’t hear the deep, clear bass, subtle midrange and crisp highs of my fave tunes with these earphones, but they give me a basic range of sound to help me get through my days on a little happier note. In addition, the earbuds feel secure and comfortable inside my ears, whether I’m using them sitting at home or running errands—when I especially appreciate the generous 3.9-foot cable length.

I also love the pink color. It’s not my favorite color, but it sure is easy to spot when I’m looking inside the black hole of my purse for a pair of earbuds! If you're looking for a satisfactory BASIC pair of earphones, your search is over!

"June 21, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Gerik Alexander Gentry,5.0,"TL:DR? These are a good pair of in ear headphones with basic mic capabilities.

The Style:
As in ear headphones, these provide higher levels of sound proof capabilities. A small, single multifunction button on the cord lets you to do a variety of things, such as pause and start music, which is handy. They are a vibrant spring pink color and come with extra silicone ear pieces for a perfect fit. They work as soon as you plug them in; no installation or adjustment of settings required. Compatible with laptops, mobile devices, etc. It takes up very little room, making it ideal for travel.

The Function:
The sound is pretty good and clear and it is quite sound proof. I love that there are additional silicone ear pieces so I can adjust for a perfect fit (or squeeze a second or third use out of them once the others get icky). These do go inside the ear, so be prepared to have to gently wipe around the edge inside and out to clean that up. The pink color is fantastic; not dull but also not neon. The microphone works so-so. It is a bit muffled sounding, but looking up and away doesn’t change how well I’m heard. Looking at the mic with it right next to my mouth does make it louder, but not earsplitting, so good sound any which way you go. There’s a multi-function button that allows me to pause my music or start back up again and I imagine this should also work with phone calls. No instruction pamphlet was given on all it’s uses, so just be aware of that. You may have to fiddle and see what magic it holds for you. These are a good replacement for the ones I’ve had for years that were falling apart. I’m quite pleased with my purchase. Notes: If it hurts in your ears after awhile, you may need to go a size down. There’s actually a pretty good size difference in the silicone ear pieces too; all pluses there. It also nestles a little in your ear, helping it to stay place further

+Pros:
+Clear audio
+Sound proof
+Adjustable sizing (different interchangeable silicone ear piece sizes)
+Good, solid pink color
+Designed to also help sit in you ear (eliminating stress from long-term wear)
+Multifunction button
+Easy to store and take with you (doesn’t take up that much space)

-Cons:
-No instructions on button options
-Muffled mic

Overall, I’m quite pleased with the product. It’s much like the earphones I had and a suitable replacement, but more colorful and fun. 5 out of 5 stars.

"April 30, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,🤗Ovrjoyd🤗,1.0,"I am usually pleased with Amazon products, so I was disappointed when I tried these. There was virtually no bass or treble, and the midrange is thin and weak. There are holes in the sound where instruments are supposed to be. The sticky rubber on the cord caught everything, and you could hear it rubbing against everything it touched. The sound of the wire rubbing against my arm was the only true fidelity I heard. There are much better earbuds in this price range so don't think you have to spend a fortune for great sounding earbuds; you don't. Sadly, these are not the best choice.",5 people found this helpful
"February 6, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,J&J,4.0,"Decent set of affordable wired earplugs.
I wanted wired bc my BT one's seem to require constant charge as they get older or,
don't want to pair so, went back to basics.

As a woman, I love the pink.
Somehow makes them easier to find in my console or backpack.

For sound quality , Talking & hearing sound quality were clear.
I mean, if you're looking for notes of bass, not gonna find it at this price point.
They don't ping your ears & volume easy to adjust on mouthpiece.

The only thing I would caution is, I was told on more than one occasion,
I was screaming when I was speaking in conversational tone.
There is no volume adjust for that fluke so just pulled the mic away from my mouth.

Played great with music, again no bass, while out & about.
Definitely worth it for a pair of plugs you won't worry about damaging or losing",2 people found this helpful
"June 16, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Matthew Schenker,5.0,"My wife walks daily for exercise and has had trouble finding a simple pair of headphones. She did not want anything fancy, or heavy, and she likes to listen to audio books, so the sound quality does not need to be phenomenal. I got her these, and she's quite happy with them. She reports that they are light and fit her well. She has used other headphones with deeper sound, but she was willing to accept lower sound for ease of use and comfort. She likes that these headphones just have the basics and that's it.

If you are looking for something with deep bass, Bluetooth capabilities, and other options, these might not be the headphones for you. But look at the price! They are clearly aiming for simple but functional, and they live up to that promise.",One person found this helpful
"January 28, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,ice grizzly,5.0,"- No noise when rubbing against jacket/shirt
- No hissing sound
- Great FM reception, yes insulation plays a key role as the headphone is the antenna in portable FM radio
- Very good frequency response. Clear vocals, nice rolled off highs and good base response. Bass is crisp and clear.

Love the build quality, just a great every day use headphone. Will surely buy again when this one breaks. Comes with small buds for younger kids, for me the default one fits perfectly.",3 people found this helpful
"March 20, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Sophia11223,1.0,"At first they were great, then after like three weeks I noticed my phone would randomly pause, play, activate Siri, skip songs, and change volume. At first I thought it was my phone acting up, then I realized that when I didn’t have the headphones plugged in it wouldn’t do that. At first I didn’t think it was a big deal, but it gradually got more and more annoying, and it drove me crazy. Finally in the middle of class it unpaused my music and turned the volume up to full volume when my headphones weren’t in. It was loud and embarrassing. Not worth the money.",4 people found this helpful
"March 25, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,🌈 KT,3.0,"- Made in China
- The cord is soft, flexible silicone
- Rather light weight
- 3 cushion sizes
- Single button in-line control on the left side, doesn't do much

While the buds were comfortable for me, the sound is just average, to me. Decent clarity, not much volume possible, decent balance, just nothing special.

Using them with the phone didn't work well. The other person could hear me fine, but I couldn't hear them very well. Very low.

What makes them not useful to me is there's no way to change volume on them. You have to do that from the phone. For some that might not be an issue, since you're plugged into it, but I just prefer to deal with the phone as little as possible.

3 stars because of that and the phone issue, but they might be useful depending on what you want them for.

"June 24, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Sarah,5.0,"I have been using these for several days and have found no issue with them. They are comfortable and offer great sound quality. I honestly chose them for the color which is probably equivalent to buying a car for the cup holders, but I’m happy with the quality of them. They’re a great price and if you’re just looking for something simple that works, these are it. I have not used the speaker feature and probably never will but it’s nice to know it’s there.
My only struggle with these is that they are so thin and I’ve had to stop and untangle them several times. Other than that, they’ve been great for binging Netflix quietly while my husband sleeps.

"February 2, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,SandyCB,4.0,"I use these headphones for my mp3 player, so I do not use the microphone and can't comment on how well that feature works. I also do not expect to have superior sound, such as I would receive from an expensive pair of headphones. That said, I'm very happy with these. The sound quality is just fine. They are exceptionally comfortable and stay in my ears easily, even when I wear them while I am trying to fall asleep. They are clearly marked left and right (and one thing I do use the mic for is to identify which side is which in the dark). Extra covers are included so you can change them to extra small or large if you need to do so. These are nice, basic headphones.",One person found this helpful
