      "I made a mistake. The original Earpods that came with my Apple iPhone 6 Plus started cutting out. I decided for the cheaper option of the Amazon headphones rather than a slightly more expensive Earpod replacement.  I now regret that decision.The Amazon headphones are not even CLOSE to the same comfort, fit, quality as the Apple Earpods.  No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fit the Amazon headphones in my ear. I tried the different sizes and twisted. They would stay in a few minutes and then pop out.  It was a disaster for exercising.I found the Amazon headphones very uncomfortable. They didn't just sit in the ears like the Apple Earpods.  They had to be squeezed inside the ear canal. Obviously Apple (and all manufactures) have patents on their designs that Amazon cannot copy.  So, Amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design.  It's just NOT good.  And it plugged the ears so much that I heard my breathing and heartbeat.  Once I put them in, I couldn't wait to get them back out.The sound quality is garbage. It's not even CLOSE to the quality of the Apple Earpods.  The sound is loud, but very harsh and tinny. I guess if I never had any headphones before and used the Amazon headphones, I would probably just accept it because I had nothing to compare it to.  However, I had the Apple Earpods, so I could make a direct comparison.  It's not even close. So, I went ahead and ordered another Apple Earpods - which is only about $5 more.  I should have done that initially.  I cannot recommend the Amazon headphones.\n",
      "These are very inexpensive headphones but they exceeded my expectations. The silicone pieces (there are 3 sets in order to fit your ears) are effective at cancelling out noise at a general office/home level. These also stay put well so long as you choose the right size of silicone cover.\n",
      "The cables are very flimsy and thin, similar to the headphones you can buy at the 99 cent store, the left headphone has a buzzing sound when listening to music, and this headphones are brand new! Very disappointed, amazon basic products used to be so much better :(\n",
      "The Amazon basic ear headphones works in the iPhones with clear and loud audio on the ear pieces as well as speaking into the mic.  Although its fidelity on both is not as good as the APPLE branded version, it is still very useable.  Will buy again and recommend this as a low cost item.\n",
      "I liked the color - my sons can't tell me that they don't know which pair is theirs...  the color identifies the perpetrator.\n",
      "My 13 year old uses these on a daily basis. She is rough on earbuds & they have held up great. Good sound quality. Would recommend!\n",
      "They produce sound but it comes with a lot of background static that is audible even with volume turned up. It would be nice if it also came with the clip to hold it to your shirt, but they discontinued those head phones. I wouldn't buy these again and I am thinking of returning them.\n",
      "These headphones are surprisingly nice for the money. better then the Raycons I returned...only issue is they won't sit right in my ear. I am going to change the buds and see if that helps.\n",
      "I usually buy Skullcandy Ink'd, but bought these to save a couple of bucks.  The buds fit more comfortably than the Ink'd, but it went downhill from there.  The wires feel stiffer and smaller gauge, which suggests they will break sooner.  When I began listening, it was quickly apparent I had wasted my money, as the sound quality was bad -- the sound is somewhat muddled, and they sound tinny with a very poor base response.  These will go into my \"shoulda know better\" drawer.On the bright side, I went back to Amazon and just scored two sets of Ink'd for the same price I paid for the bad set.Such is Life\n",
      "Who'd have thunk it? Noise-canceling earbuds for less than $9?I needed wired earbuds to use on my laptop now that this COVID-19 pandemic has 97% of people staying at home. I'm lucky enough to have a job I can do remotely and my company has been using Zoom video conferencing. My wireless Bluetooth headphones didn't present a professional appearance, not to mention my phone kept fighting my laptop for the BT connection.These cheap earbuds sound great and the built-in speaker on the left earbud wire makes my voice very clear. It has made my stay-at-home time a little more bearable.\n",
      "==================\n",
      "page 2 Crawling...\n",
      "==================\n",
      "The cable literately broke with no force, before this the sound quality was fuzzy, the mic people only heard static. Seriously 100 times worse than $2 pair I bought at Bartel drugs. I am an audiophile and have headphones of all varieties, I wanted something I could toss in my work bag for conference calls, its sad Amazon has stooped to relabeling the cheapest Chinese crap they can get their hands on, I expected a lot more from Amazon, especially for the higher price.\n",
      "After 2.5 years with my trusty earbuds that came with my iPhone died after a tug-o-war with my dog, it came time for me to go on the hunt for a new pair of earbuds.  My budget was a laughable $10, just because I only use these when I'm out jogging with my dog.  After a few misses, I settled on these AmazonBasics earbuds.  I was wary because of the lack of reviews on this product, but given how everything I've bought from AmazonBasics has been of decent quality, I figured \"why not?\".  I've had these guys for a little over a month and I'm so pleasantly surprised by the quality.  I'm usually not a fan of the earbuds with the fitted earbuds, as they have always come off as uncomfortable for me.  These were surprisingly comfortable.  I think it's because the shape of the contour is more oval than circular, so it fits better with the ear hole.  The tangle-free cord is amazing, and it's at a good length where it's not too long nor too short.  The speaker and mic are decent, I haven't experienced any static nor has the people I've talked to on the phone heard rustling sounds from the mic brushing against my clothes.  Overall, I'm pretty sure this is one of the best deals you can get at this price point.\n",
      "I purchased the a white pair of AmazonBasics In-Ear wired Headphone Earbuds with a microphone. These work great and I haven't had any issues. They sound great with the exception of me wanting more bass. However; I buy a good pair of ear buds separately that are to certain specifications to include heavy Bass and I purchased these AmazonBasics as a back up pair.These sound great and are equivalent to headphone earbuds double the cost. I usually allow myself 20$ for back up earbuds and figured I'd save some cash by buying these and gave them a shot. They work just as well as more expensive pairs and fit better then most. Definitely recommend as a decent pair and already bought myself a lime green pair instead of the white for another back up. If you're looking for a pair with good stereo bass then you may be satisfied because it's there... but I wasn't because I like more of a range than these buds deliver. The other sound ranges are there and sound better than many ear buds I've tried and are well worth the price. Functionality is there with the button working for answering the phone and pausing of media.\n",
      "They sound great, noise cancel unless kids are screaming at each other and are somewhat comfortable.  I do not like the \"ergonomic\" earbud where you have to put it in the correct ear.  If it's not in exactly correct it feels like the hard plastic ear buds.  I haven't tried the microphone so I can't review that. Over all it's a pretty good earbud for the price.  I would recommend it to someone who doesn't mind the r/l earbud setup.\n",
      "So I typically purchase the Panasonic wired earbuds because they fit my ears the best and the sound is decent.  However I have noticed lately the price has been climbing and I decided to look for an more cost effective alternative.  These fit the bill.  Their sound quality and shape are comparable to the ones I usually buy and they were cheaper.  The only thing that was really different was that the mic was on the left wire when typically it's in the right in past wired earbuds I've purchased. Not at all and issue for me and maybe a great option for left handed individuals!\n",
      "The product came wrapped in bubble wrap and tape, no real packaging.  The sound quality would be great but their is a lot of static.  The tips are pretty comfortable and it stayed in my ear on treadmill. I got the red and the color is very muted, almost pastel like, I was hoping the color was more bold or bright. At least they were cheap, might not return and just keep for backup.\n",
      "These seem comparable to the Apple wired earbuds that come w iPhone but WAY more comfortable and lightweight. So much so i prefer them over any ear plugs I always use at night. Thats because they fit better and cancel noise better.  Been knowing I shldnt wait for them to get damaged, need to order couple extra sets of these for their nice $8sumthing price.  However, these dont have as much bass as my “Tidybuds” wireless Bluetooth ear buds from Groupon.  But I’m ok with that because I use these at bedtime for ASMR and just keep them in, unplug from phone.\n",
      "They were physically fine, comfortable and I don’t even have high sound quality requirements, I mainly listen to podcasts or audiobooks...but these are a total fail.  Crackle and static from the first use.  Pass\n",
      "I bought these in white for $7.87 and also a pair of Sephia SO3060 wired earbuds for $12.95.  I liked these much better for listening to audiobooks and courses - the sound quality was clearer.  The comfort was about the same for each set-not bad - I just used the ear tips that were on them when they came.  The packaging of the Sephia earbuds was a fancy 3 layer arrangement that was impossible to get open without tearing the box so I guess I can't return them.  The Amazon wired earbuds are much more tangle free than my previous pair, and they came simply packed in a small plastic bag that was very easy to open.\n",
      "Sound constantly breaks up, heavy static. It's really hard to hear anything over the breaking soundEdit: I've had the earbuds for 6 weeks now because I was too lazy to return them, and only one ear works at a time! I can turn the jack and switch ears, but I'm shocked as I used to always trust Amazon Basics.\n"

      "Worked for 2 weeks. Barely any sounds came out now\n",
      "It's been a real long time since I've bought headphones at any price-point that sound awful at any volume.Pros:- it works?- the bass is surprisingly decent?Cons:- distortion at ANY volume- feels cheaper than competitors at this price pointNotes: they have attempted to create a much wider soundstage than these headphones are capable of delivering, as a result the instant a song gets even slightly intense it will distort across the entire soundstage, obviously this is unacceptable. I've had much better experiences with headphones in this same price-point, your better off trying literally any other cheap headphones on amazon, please do not buy these.\n",
      "These work well for me. Much lower price than Skullcanndy. Fast delivery.\n",
      "This is my second pair of Amazon Basics ear buds. Last pair made it almost 2 years of daily use, ordered these as a replacement.Mechanical isolation is outstanding just putting these in drops the noise level considerably. 3 sizes of tips included. No line noise from taps. Cable could be longer. Very comfortable snug fit in ear.Clean bass, good response throughout the spectrum. Mostly use for vdo chat, but testing with some Amazon Prime video gives immersive sound. This is not audiophile gear but certainly gets the job done. Very impressed with the improvement on the last Amazon Basics ear buds I purchased - well worth being double the price.\n",
      "I’m a teacher and bought this product since we start virtual teaching and needed headphones with a mic so my students could hear me clearly. The headphones maybe sounded well for 5 seconds, 6 seconds tops, then it made my students sound like robots who are powered by dollar store batteries. I’m in quarantine so I can’t return them at the moment, and I have to order a different set 🙄Y’all know how much teachers make??? I don’t have the time or money to be buy headphones just for them to not work. I miss hearing my students complain about math and now I won’t be able to hear the sighs when they realize they still have 79 minutes of class left.In all seriousness, save your money and don’t buy these ear bud head phones.\n",
      "I bought these when I needed a pair of earbuds in a hurry.  I have \"good\" ones, but I had forgotten to bring them.  Since these were basically supposed to be just for one day, I didn't want to spend much, and I didn't have high expectations.  What a nice surprise I got with these.  For under $10, they're comfortable, and work really well.  The don't block out noise completely, like my fancy pair, but they provide decent sound and don't hurt my ears.  They were supposed to be a one day patch, but I like them so well that I keep them in my bag all the time.  I'm not mad when I have to pull them out to get me through a commute!\n",
      "I mean, they're not Bose or Beats or anything like that, BUT they are surprisingly good. The bass is good, and they can be VERY loud, or pretty quiet, so the volume control is good. They come with more ear cushions if your ears are smaller or bigger than the default ones, so they fit very nice. Truthfully, I think the sound quality with these is just as good as my AirPods, and they fit better. The only thing I like better about the AirPods is that they're Bluetooth and these are obviously not. You should totally buy these!\n",
      "I have 2 pairs of earphones - these and the really good Panasonic ones and I got these because that one has an L-shaped jack that wouldn't go with my phone case - and this one is a trooper just like that one. Great sound quality and wonderful durability. The straight jack on this works perfectly with my phone so that makes it very convenient for me. The cord is a good length.\n",
      "I love pink! I needed a pair that my husband and teenage boys wouldn’t mistake for the pair that comes in the box with the iPhone.There are a couple of features that I wasn’t aware of:1) You will need a converter to use with your iPhone X2) the control button is NOT for volume. You will only be able to start and stop music or use the microphone.Nevertheless, it’s definitely a keeper since I have an earphone converter and it’s the perfect shade of pink💕\n",
      "Left earbud did not work right out of the box.  Very cheap feeling plastic parts and I'm not used to expensive earbuds so I'm not making an unfair comparison. To Amazon's credit, they say they will issue an immediate refund but I will not purchase these again. I'll spend a few dollars more (these were about $9) and get some of a little higher quality,  I hope.\n",
      "==================\n",
      "page 4 Crawling...\n",
      "==================\n",
      "The first time i used them for a phone call there was an echo on both sides of the call.  But after a minute the echo went away and I haven't heard it since.  They are very comfortable and the sound is great. I got more than I expected from the purchase.\n",
      "These headphones are bare-bones, you can hear from them and they have a mic, that's it.  Want something fancy?  You're looking in the wrong place.  Want something that can take a beating and will work perfectly fine for years to come?  These are what you're looking for.  I keep them as a backup for my wireless headphones for video calls and such; while they won't blow your mind with sound quality or comfort they get the job done!\n",
      "I bought these b/c the Amazon Basics HEADPHONES were of great sound quality. Needless to say, I was VERY disappointed and this was the worst earbud I've ever tried. THE WORST, that includes the ones I've bought from dollar tree. Its only saving grace was that it was designed well and came with earbuds of different sizes. That's it.DO NOT BUY, save money for the Amazon Basics Headphones or buy earphones from a different brand, these were TERRIBLE.\n",
      "It was worth a try to get something in a hurry, but these would make better shoelaces than headphones. Half an hour wearing these during a video stream was headache enough. I thought I had suddenly developed tinnitus --in both ears at once!  I wish I was exaggerating. Hopefully the company can find a way to improve their product in the future, even if that would mean raising the price. Best of luck!\n",
      "Even the smallest extra plug cover that come with it are too large for my ears.  For that matter, even with no plug covers on, it is too big for my ears.  They just sit slightly inside the ear, even the smallest head movement causes them to fall out of the ear.  If you have large ears, they may be fine.\n",
      "I have a hard time finding comfortable in ear headphones. But I love the in ear headphones because I work in a noisy environment. These cover both my needs they are small and fit in my ears comfortably and block out the majority of the noise around me. I was worried about the quality due to the low price, but they are very nice and I am not disappointed. I would buy them again.\n",
      "Edit:  There just isn't enough strain relief for the cable at the jack.  A few mild accidental tugs and you'll lose either one headphone or the mic. I've had 2 pair fail in quick succession.These are perfectly acceptable for what I paid.  I do really wish they had a right-angle connector, but that was not a listed feature so it's not a knock on the product.Weird note: I got a sealed package that only had the baggy of earphone covers and no headphones and Amazon wanted the basically empty box returned before they'd issue the refund.\n",
      "I used them for listening to music and playing games on ipad/phone. I had tried many earbuds on amazon, some are durable yet a bit more expensive and very sharp color (which I don't like), some are cheap yet lasted only a few days. I decided to try their amazon brand. When they first arrived, I was a bit disappointed, as the pink color is a little deeper than the pictures. However, when I start using them... it was like WOW. Good quality, noise isolation, comfortable and DURABLE for the price! Definitely consider to repurchase (if these break, but I don't think its gonna be recent lol)\n",
      "I use headphones to watch videos during my morning commute. The sound quality is good; not great or bad. I couldn't get a good fit with any of the earbuds but use the largest and they fit snug.  They've held up far better than other brands. I used to go through a set about every month.\n",
      "Comfortable, inexpensive, and easy to keep track of.Sound quality is there, nothing super bass heavy mind you, but considering you're using earbuds I wouldn't expect anything more than moderate bass.The price was definitely right and I'm the event one of my pets or myself breaks these, I'll know where to go to get the replacement set :D\n"

      "I buy cheap earbuds because I have a tendency to lose or break several pairs a year. The inexpensive Panasonic and Sony earbuds I typically buy hold up relatively well, have good sound quality, and don't feel super cheap. These Amazon Basics earbuds, on the other hand, have horrible sound quality (super staticky, weak base), are covered in that weird tacky-feeling coating that is going to be disgusting in about a week, and are pretty uncomfortable to wear. On the plus side, the mic works okay and there are a variety of the little silicone covers for the actual earbuds (I just don't find any of them work for me). I'll probably end up keeping these in my desk at work and repurchasing the same old Panasonic ones I broke last week.\n",
      "The only reason these get one star is because I cannot give them zero. Within 5 minutes these headphones started crackling with static and sound so bad they are unusable. They may be the lowest quality product I've ever purchased from Amazon.\n",
      "These headphones are very good for the price. Sound quality is good. These may not great option for noise cancellation or for working out (as wires may come in your way). These headphones will help you for daily use and comfortably fit in the ear and to make phones calls.\n",
      "The sound isn’t as flat as I was expecting for the price.I Love that these earbuds block out some sound so it’s easy to listen to music and watch videos in the same room as other people and not be competing or need to turn up the volume really high.I had to buy two just in case so that I have a backup pair.\n",
      "With all the online meetings, these were necessary and for the price, they are a good deal. The one thing I wish it had was volume control on the headset, which it does not. It only has a button that would answer/hang up a call. After a while, Apple earbuds were hurting my ears so badly after a long day of work and these are soft and cushioned.\n",
      "Do not buy this product. I ordered these a few times in past and they do not last. I ordered another recently in January thinking maybe it was something i was doing wrong and no, they just don’t last. They are comfortable, but it’s a shame how cheaply made they are.\n",
      "I left home without my earbuds and had to order these and ship them to my hotel.  I searched Amazon for ear buds that were compatible with an iPhone Xr and this popped up.  I ordered it without reading carefully enough.  When it arrived it was NOT compatible.  I then had to spend an additional $25 at the airport for a converter to use this with an Iphone.  This is probably my fault for trusting the search and should have checked the plug.\n",
      "They're great, very inexpensive. I bought 3 to keep in a gym bag, car and one at work cause I always forget themThey sound great, good length and the sound quality is really amazing. Very bass heavy.I love the colors too.Wish they had volume controls, wish I knew if they were water proof. They feel frail but I'm not worries about these.\n",
      "These disconnect on calls and continuously pause music while trying to listen. The chord is also very bulky, and these are pretty bad. The only thing that’s good is the sound quality, but the on and off pausing takes away from that no matter what. Wouldn’t reccomend\n",
      "These have a solid bass, no tinny sound.  The microphone is clear. All in all a good set of eqrphones.\n",

       "[\"I made a mistake. The original Earpods that came with my Apple iPhone 6 Plus started cutting out. I decided for the cheaper option of the Amazon headphones rather than a slightly more expensive Earpod replacement.  I now regret that decision.The Amazon headphones are not even CLOSE to the same comfort, fit, quality as the Apple Earpods.  No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fit the Amazon headphones in my ear. I tried the different sizes and twisted. They would stay in a few minutes and then pop out.  It was a disaster for exercising.I found the Amazon headphones very uncomfortable. They didn't just sit in the ears like the Apple Earpods.  They had to be squeezed inside the ear canal. Obviously Apple (and all manufactures) have patents on their designs that Amazon cannot copy.  So, Amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design.  It's just NOT good.  And it plugged the ears so much that I heard my breathing and heartbeat.  Once I put them in, I couldn't wait to get them back out.The sound quality is garbage. It's not even CLOSE to the quality of the Apple Earpods.  The sound is loud, but very harsh and tinny. I guess if I never had any headphones before and used the Amazon headphones, I would probably just accept it because I had nothing to compare it to.  However, I had the Apple Earpods, so I could make a direct comparison.  It's not even close. So, I went ahead and ordered another Apple Earpods - which is only about $5 more.

These also stay put well so long as you choose the right size of silicone cover.',\n",
       " 'The cables are very flimsy and thin, similar to the headphones you can buy at the 99 cent store, the left headphone has a buzzing sound when listening to music, and this headphones are brand new! Very disappointed, amazon basic products used to be so much better :(',\n",
       " 'The Amazon basic ear headphones works in the iPhones with clear and loud audio on the ear pieces as well as speaking into the mic.  Although its fidelity on both is not as good as the APPLE branded version, it is still very useable.  Will buy again and recommend this as a low cost item.',\n",

       " \"They produce sound but it comes with a lot of background static that is audible even with volume turned up. It would be nice if it also came with the clip to hold it to your shirt, but they discontinued those head phones. I wouldn't buy these again and I am thinking of returning them.\",\n",
       " \"These headphones are surprisingly nice for the money. better then the Raycons I returned...only issue is they won't sit right in my ear. I am going to change the buds and see if that helps.\",\n",
       " 'I usually buy Skullcandy Ink\\'d, but bought these to save a couple of bucks.  The buds fit more comfortably than the Ink\\'d, but it went downhill from there.  The wires feel stiffer and smaller gauge, which suggests they will break sooner.  When I began listening, it was quickly apparent I had wasted my money, as the sound quality was bad -- the sound is somewhat muddled, and they sound tinny with a very poor base response.  These will go into my \"shoulda know better\" drawer.On the bright side, I went back to Amazon and just scored two sets of Ink\\'d for the same price I paid for the bad set.Such is Life',\n",
       " \"Who'd have thunk it? Noise-canceling earbuds for less than $9?I needed wired earbuds to use on my laptop now that this COVID-19 pandemic has 97% of people staying at home. I'm lucky enough to have a job I can do remotely and my company has been using Zoom video conferencing. My wireless Bluetooth headphones didn't present a professional appearance, not to mention my phone kept fighting my laptop for the BT connection.These cheap earbuds sound great and the built-in speaker on the left earbud wire makes my voice very clear. It has made my stay-at-home time a little more bearable.\"]"
