"March 22, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Rick Layton,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I made a mistake. The original Earpods that came with my Apple iPhone 6 Plus started cutting out. I decided for the cheaper option of the Amazon headphones rather than a slightly more expensive Earpod replacement.  I now regret that decision.The Amazon headphones are not even CLOSE to the same comfort, fit, quality as the Apple Earpods.  No matter how I tried, I just couldn't fit the Amazon headphones in my ear. I tried the different sizes and twisted. They would stay in a few minutes and then pop out.  It was a disaster for exercising.I found the Amazon headphones very uncomfortable. They didn't just sit in the ears like the Apple Earpods.  They had to be squeezed inside the ear canal. Obviously Apple (and all manufactures) have patents on their designs that Amazon cannot copy.  So, Amazon must have been very limited in their choice of design.  It's just NOT good.  And it plugged the ears so much that I heard my breathing and heartbeat.  Once I put them in, I couldn't wait to get them back out.The sound quality is garbage. It's not even CLOSE to the quality of the Apple Earpods.  The sound is loud, but very harsh and tinny. I guess if I never had any headphones before and used the Amazon headphones, I would probably just accept it because I had nothing to compare it to.  However, I had the Apple Earpods, so I could make a direct comparison.  It's not even close. So, I went ahead and ordered another Apple Earpods - which is only about $5 more.  I should have done that initially.  I cannot recommend the Amazon headphones.",87 people found this helpful
"April 3, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Emily,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are very inexpensive headphones but they exceeded my expectations. The silicone pieces (there are 3 sets in order to fit your ears) are effective at cancelling out noise at a general office/home level. These also stay put well so long as you choose the right size of silicone cover.,63 people found this helpful

"February 11, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Ed W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The Amazon basic ear headphones works in the iPhones with clear and loud audio on the ear pieces as well as speaking into the mic.

"February 11, 2019",Reviewed in the United States,Daniel ,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They produce sound but it comes with a lot of background static that is audible even with volume turned up.

"July 21, 2020",Reviewed in the United States,Bob K,2.0 out of 5 stars,"I usually buy Skullcandy Ink'd, but bought these to save a couple of bucks.  The buds fit more comfortably than the Ink'd, but it went downhill from there.  The wires feel stiffer and smaller gauge, which suggests they will break sooner.  When I began listening, it was quickly apparent I had wasted my money, as the sound quality was bad -- the sound is somewhat muddled, and they sound tinny with a very poor base response.  These will go into my ""shoulda know better"" drawer.On the bright side, I went back to Amazon and just scored two sets of Ink'd for the same price I paid for the bad set.Such is Life",7 people found this helpful

Noise-canceling earbuds for less than $9?I needed wired earbuds to use on my laptop now that this COVID-19 pandemic has 97% of people staying at home.
